## 📝 Project Description
Glitch Café is an immersive, interactive website that transforms a simple café menu into a chaotic, ever-changing experience.  
The menu constantly glitches — flickering text, shifting prices, and changing "Specials of the Second." Images distort with static and hue shifts, and surreal customer reviews appear in random, contradictory, and non-linear order.  
Each menu item has its own interactive page with unique “side effects,” making the site feel alive, unpredictable, and full of hidden secrets for visitors to uncover.
